# automation_cookie_game

This script was created with Python and the Selenium Web Driver API to automate an online cookie clicking game (https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/)

The goal of the cookie clicking game is to make as many cookies as possible where a player makes a cookie by clicking on a large cookie button. As more and more cookies are created, player upgrades are unlocked at certain cookie creation milestones to increase the rate at which cookies are made. 

The following Python script automates the cookie clicking and player upgrade mechanisms of the game. After 1 minute of automation, the cookies created per second rate is printed to console and the program terminates.
